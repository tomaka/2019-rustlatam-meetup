# Introduction: what is libp2p?

Libp2p is a protocol and library for creating decentralized peer-to-peer networks.

https://libp2p.io/

- Used by IPFS, Filecoin, Substrate, Polkadot.
- Probably going to be used by Ethereum 2.0 and a large number of projects in the Ethereum space.
- Designed and managed by Protocol Labs (https://protocol.ai/).

# First attempt: through emscripten, end of 2017

- Modified `libp2p-websocket` to include a `BrowserWsConfig` struct that uses `stdweb`.
- Compile to binary, and emscripten generates JavaScript and WASM files.

- Modified `libp2p-websocket` to include a `BrowserWsConfig` struct that uses `stdweb`.
- Compile to binary, and emscripten generates JavaScript and WASM files.
- Problem: what polls the `Future`? There's no `tokio` runtime available.

A more general problem is:

## Let's ditch Emscripten

- Let's use `wasm-bindgen` instead!
- <s>Emscripten</s> => Wasm
- <s>Compiling into a binary</s> => Compile into a WASM library<br/>This library is usable from JavaScript.
- No `main` function.

TODO: add schema binary => library

## Issue #1

- The `ring` library doesn't compile!
- `ring` uses inline assembly, and obviously doesn't have a WASM or JavaScript
implementation.

## Issue #1

- The `ring` library doesn't compile!
- `ring` uses inline assembly, and obviously doesn't have a WASM or JavaScript
implementation.

Solution:

- Replaced as much cryptographic code as possible with pure Rust libraries, which might or might
  not be a good idea.
- No pure Rust code for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, so rewrote it with WebCrypto using
  wasm-bindgen.

---

# Second attempt: since end of 2018

Didn't go as planned!

## Issue #2

- Compiling failed with obscure error about files being in the wrong format.
- Bug somewhere in the C code compilation. C libraries don't properly compile to WASM at the moment.

## Issue #2

- Compiling failed with obscure error about files being in the wrong format.
- Bug somewhere in the C code compilation. C libraries don't properly compile to WASM at the moment.

Solution:

- Had to replace `secp256k1` (bindings to a C library) with `rust-secp256k1` (pure Rust).
- Had to directly depend on the `clear_on_drop` crate in order to enable the `no_cc` feature.

---

# Second attempt: since end of 2018

Didn't go as planned!

## Issue #3

- Compilation failed with some obscure missing symbols.
- It turns out that `stdweb` and `wasm-bindgen` don't well go together. They are two different
ecosystems.

## Issue #3

- Compilation failed with some obscure missing symbols.
- It turns out that `stdweb` and `wasm-bindgen` don't well go together. They are two different
ecosystems.

Solution:

- Had to rewrite the websocket code to use `wasm-bindgen` and `web-sys`, instead of `stdweb`.

# Second attempt: since end of 2018

# Second attempt: since end of 2018

## Issue #4

- Panic when generating a random number with the `rand` crate.

---

# Second attempt: since end of 2018

Finally compiled! But doesn't run!

## Issue #4

- Panic when generating a random number with the `rand` crate.

Solution:

- Had to depend on `rand` and activate the `wasm-bindgen` feature flag.
- A lot of crates have an obscure feature flag that really shouldn't be an optional feature in an
ideal world.

# Second attempt: since end of 2018

## Issue #5

- Panics when calling `Instant::now()`.

---

# Second attempt: since end of 2018

Finally compiled! But doesn't run!

## Issue #5

- Panics when calling `Instant::now()`.
- Problem: the `std` crate is available for wasm32-unknown-unknown, but panics whenever you try
  to do any I/O.

---

## Issue #5

- Panics when calling `Instant::now()`.
- Problem: the `std` crate is available for wasm32-unknown-unknown, but panics whenever you try
  to do I/O.

Solution:

- Had to write a `wasm-time` crate. Everything that uses `std::time::Instant` uses
`wasm_time::Instant` instead.
- `wasm_time::Instant::now()` calls `window.performance().now()` in JavaScript.

---

# Second attempt: since end of 2018

Finally compiled! But doesn't run!

## Issue #6

- Errors when using `tokio_timer::Delay` or `tokio_timer::Interval`, because no tokio context is
  set.

---

# Second attempt: since end of 2018

Finally compiled! But doesn't run!

## Issue #6

- Errors when using `tokio_timer::Delay` or `tokio_timer::Interval`, because no tokio context is
set.
- When you call `tokio::run` (or use a tokio runtime in general), tokio puts a `Clock` object in
a TLS that is then retreived by `tokio_timer`. If this value is lacking, it errors.

---

## Issue #6

set.
- When you call `tokio::run` (or use a tokio runtime in general), tokio puts a `Clock` object in
a TLS that is then retreived by `tokio_timer`. If this value is lacking, it errors.

Solution:

- Added mock `tokio_timer` equivalents in `wasm-time`, that use `setTimeout`.

## Issue #7

- Wanted to try against IPFS nodes, but IPFS uses RSA.
- No pure Rust RSA implementation!

---

## Issue #7

- Wanted to try against IPFS nodes, but IPFS uses RSA.
- No pure Rust RSA implementation!

Solution:

- [Not done yet] Use WebCrypto for RSA.
